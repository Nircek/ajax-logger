Display the data from any JSON API in a table format, updating it every second. I designed the tool with querying data from [the rocket controller](https://github.com/AGH-Space-Systems/szarus-avionics) in mind.

## Features

- Display the data in real-time
- Measure the time of requests
- Export the data to CSV format
- Auto-scroll the table when new data arrives
- Remember the last retrieved URL
- Work offline as a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)

## Installation

Just open [this page](https://nircek.github.io/ajax-logger/), and your browser already cached it. You can access it offline now.
